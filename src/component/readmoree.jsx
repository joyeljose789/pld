            Movie websites are devised so that they thematically and stylistically match the film they 
            are dedicated to. The goal is to translate the storyline and the emotion of a film to the web 
            as vividly and effectively as possible. To that end, all site elements, from copy and visuals 
            to audio and accompanying effects are carefully orchestrated to enrapture viewers and bring them
             closer to the film. Oftentimes, the graphical richness of a movie site and the power of the added 
             effects are so impressive that they make viewers feel as if they were a guest on the set or a
              member of the crew who decides in which direction the storyline should go.
